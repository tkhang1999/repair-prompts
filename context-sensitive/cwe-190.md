CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound

Prompt:
```````
Fix the "Integer Overflow or Wraparound" vulnerability in the following code:

```js
const a = new Uint16Array(2);

a[0] = 23456789;
a[1] = -15;

console.log(a)
```
```````

Output:

To fix the "Integer Overflow or Wraparound" vulnerability in the given code, you should be mindful of the range of values that can be represented by Uint16Array. In JavaScript, Uint16Array represents 16-bit unsigned integers, which have a range from 0 to 65535.

If you try to assign a value greater than 65535 to an element in the Uint16Array, it will wrap around, causing unexpected behavior. To avoid this issue, you should ensure that the values assigned are within the valid range. Here's an updated version of the code:

```js
const a = new Uint16Array(2);

// Ensure that the values are within the valid range for Uint16Array
a[0] = Math.min(23456789, 65535);
a[1] = Math.max(-15, 0);

console.log(a);
```

The provided code snippet exhibits an integer overflow vulnerability when assigning the value 23456789 to the first element of the Uint16Array. The Uint16Array can only store values within the range of 0 to 65535 (2^16 - 1). Assigning a value larger than this range will cause integer overflow, resulting in an unexpected value being stored.

To fix this vulnerability, you can check the value before assigning it to the array element. If the value exceeds the maximum value of Uint16Array, you can either clamp it to the maximum value or handle the overflow in a more appropriate manner.

Here's the modified code with the overflow check:

```js
const a = new Uint16Array(2);
const maxValue = 65535; // Maximum value of Uint16Array

let value = 23456789;

if (value > maxValue) {
  value = maxValue; // Clamp the value to the maximum
}

a[0] = value;
a[1] = -15;

console.log(a);
```
