Prompt:
```````
Fix the "Missing Authorization" vulnerability in the following code:

```js
const mysql = require('mysql');

function runEmployeeQuery(name, callback) {
  const connection = mysql.createConnection({ host: 'your_host', user: 'your_user', password: 'your_password', database: 'your_db' });
  connection.connect();

  const query = 'SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name = ?';
  connection.query(query, [name], (error, results) => {
    connection.end();
    callback(error, results);
  });
}
```
```````

Output:

The code you provided appears to be a database query function that retrieves employee information based on the provided name. The vulnerability here is that the code lacks any form of access control or authorization checks, allowing anyone to execute this query without proper authentication.

To address the "Missing Authorization" vulnerability, you should implement authentication and authorization mechanisms. This may include checking user roles, permissions, or validating user sessions before allowing access to certain resources. Here's an example of how you might update the code to include a basic authentication check:

```js
const mysql = require('mysql');

function runEmployeeQuery(name, user, callback) {
  if (!isUserAuthenticated(user)) {
    const error = new Error('Unauthorized access. Please log in.');
    return callback(error, null);
  }

  const connection = mysql.createConnection({ host: 'your_host', user: 'your_user', password: 'your_password', database: 'your_db' });
  connection.connect();

  const query = 'SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name = ?';
  connection.query(query, [name], (error, results) => {
    connection.end();
    callback(error, results);
  });
}

function isUserAuthenticated(user) {
  // Implement your authentication logic here
  // For simplicity, let's assume the user is authenticated if the user object exists
  return user !== null && typeof user === 'object';
}
```
