CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read

Prompt:
```````
Fix the "Out-of-bounds Read" vulnerability in the following code:

```js
function getValueFromArray(array, index) {
  let value;

  if (index < array.length) {
	value = array[index];
  } else {
	console.error(`Error: Index ${index} is out of bounds.`);
	value = -1;
  }

  return value;
}
```

To fix the "Out-of-bounds Read" vulnerability in the given code, you should ensure that the index is within the bounds of the array before attempting to access the element. Here's an updated version of the code:

```js
function getValueFromArray(array, index) {
  let value;

  if (index >= 0 && index < array.length) {
    value = array[index];
  } else {
    console.error(`Error: Index ${index} is out of bounds.`);
    value = -1;
  }

  return value;
}
```

The provided code is vulnerable to an "Out-of-bounds Read" vulnerability, which occurs when the index is outside the bounds of the array. This can lead to undefined behavior, including accessing invalid memory locations or causing the program to crash.

To fix this vulnerability, we can check the value of index before accessing the array. If index is outside of the bounds of the array, we can print an error message and return -1.

Here is the fixed code:

```js
function getValueFromArray(array, index) {
  if (index < 0 || index >= len(array)) {
    console.error(`Error: Index ${index} is out of bounds.`);
    return -1;
  } else {
    return array[index];
  }
}
```
