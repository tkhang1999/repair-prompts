CWE-287: Improper Authentication

Prompt:
```````
Fix the "Improper Authentication" vulnerability in the following code:

```js
const loggedinCookie = document.cookie.match(/loggedin=true/);

if (loggedinCookie) {
  console.log('User is logged in!');
} else {
  console.log('Please login!');
}
```
```````

Output:

The provided code uses a client-side approach to check whether a user is logged in by inspecting a cookie. However, relying solely on client-side checks for authentication is insecure, as users can manipulate client-side code and cookies. A more secure approach is to perform authentication on the server side and use secure session management techniques.

Assuming you have a server-side authentication mechanism, you should check the user's authentication status on the server and then send that information to the client. Here's a simple example using server-side logic:

```js
// Assuming you have server-side logic to determine the user's authentication status
const isAuthenticated = checkUserAuthenticationStatus();

if (isAuthenticated) {
  console.log('User is logged in!');
} else {
  console.log('Please login!');
}
```

The provided code is vulnerable to improper authentication because it relies solely on the presence of a cookie named "loggedin" to determine whether a user is logged in. An attacker could easily manipulate this cookie to gain unauthorized access to the system.

To fix this vulnerability, you should implement a more secure authentication mechanism, such as using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) or session tokens stored on the server-side. These mechanisms provide a more reliable way to verify a user's identity and prevent unauthorized access.
