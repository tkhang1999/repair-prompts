CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type

Prompt:
```````
Fix the "Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type" vulnerability in the following code:

```js
const express = require('express');
const fs = require('fs');
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

app.post('/upload', (req, res) => {
  const fileName = req.body.filename;
  const fileContent = req.body.fileContent;

  fs.writeFileSync(`uploads/${fileName}`, fileContent);

  res.send('File uploaded successfully.');
});
```

The code you provided is vulnerable to the "Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type" security issue, commonly known as a "file upload vulnerability." In the current implementation, the server accepts a filename and content directly from the client, allowing potential malicious activities such as uploading files with dangerous types or overwriting critical files.

To mitigate this vulnerability, you should implement proper checks on the file type and possibly restrict the allowed file types. Additionally, consider using a secure file storage strategy to prevent executing or serving potentially harmful files.

Here's an example of how you can improve the code:

```js
const express = require('express');
const fs = require('fs');
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

const allowedFileTypes = ['txt', 'pdf', 'doc']; // Define the allowed file types

app.post('/upload', (req, res) => {
  const fileName = req.body.filename;
  const fileContent = req.body.fileContent;

  // Validate file type
  const fileType = getFileType(fileName);

  if (!fileType || !allowedFileTypes.includes(fileType)) {
    return res.status(400).send('Invalid file type.');
  }

  // Use a secure file storage strategy, e.g., create a unique filename
  const uniqueFileName = generateUniqueFileName(fileName);

  fs.writeFileSync(`uploads/${uniqueFileName}`, fileContent);

  res.send('File uploaded successfully.');
});

function getFileType(fileName) {
  const parts = fileName.split('.');
  return parts.length > 1 ? parts[parts.length - 1].toLowerCase() : null;
}

function generateUniqueFileName(fileName) {
  // Generate a unique filename, e.g., by appending a timestamp or using a UUID
  const timestamp = Date.now();
  return `${timestamp}_${fileName}`;
}
```

To fix the "Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type" vulnerability, you need to implement a whitelist of allowed file extensions or MIME types. This will prevent users from uploading potentially dangerous files, such as executable scripts or malicious code. Here's the updated code:

```js
const express = require('express');
const fs = require('fs');
const allowedExtensions = ['jpg', 'png', 'gif', 'txt', 'pdf', 'doc', 'docx'];
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

app.post('/upload', (req, res) => {
  const fileName = req.body.filename;
  const fileExtension = fileName.split('.').pop();
  const fileContent = req.body.fileContent;

  if (!allowedExtensions.includes(fileExtension)) {
    res.status(400).send('Invalid file extension.');
    return;
  }

  fs.writeFileSync(`uploads/${fileName}`, fileContent);

  res.send('File uploaded successfully.');
});
```
