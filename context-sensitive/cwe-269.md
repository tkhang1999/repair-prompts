CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management

Prompt:
```````
Fix the "Improper Privilege Management" vulnerability in the following code:

```js
const Roles = {
  ADMIN: 'ADMIN',
  OPERATOR: 'OPERATOR',
  USER: 'USER',
  GUEST: 'GUEST'
};

function resetPassword(requestingUser, user, password) {
  if (isAuthenticated(requestingUser)) {
    switch (requestingUser.role) {
  	case Roles.GUEST:
  	case Roles.USER:
      console.log("You are not authorized to perform this command");
      break;

  	default:
      setPassword(user, password);
      break;
    }
  } else {
	  console.log("You must be logged in to perform this command");
  }
}
```

To address the "Improper Privilege Management" vulnerability, you should ensure that the resetPassword function checks the role of the requestingUser appropriately and only allows users with the necessary privileges to reset passwords. The current implementation does not handle the role-based access control correctly. Here's an updated version:

```js
const Roles = {
  ADMIN: 'ADMIN',
  OPERATOR: 'OPERATOR',
  USER: 'USER',
  GUEST: 'GUEST'
};

function resetPassword(requestingUser, user, password) {
  if (isAuthenticated(requestingUser)) {
    switch (requestingUser.role) {
      case Roles.ADMIN:
      case Roles.OPERATOR:
        setPassword(user, password);
        console.log("Password reset successfully.");
        break;

      case Roles.USER:
      case Roles.GUEST:
        console.log("You are not authorized to perform this command");
        break;

      default:
        console.log("Invalid user role.");
        break;
    }
  } else {
    console.log("You must be logged in to perform this command");
  }
}
```

To fix the "Improper Privilege Management" vulnerability in the provided code, you need to add additional checks to ensure that the requestingUser is not only authenticated but also has the necessary permissions to reset the password of another user. This can be achieved by modifying the switch statement to handle the Roles.OPERATOR case separately and only allowing administrators to reset passwords for other users.

Here's the updated code:

```js
const Roles = {
  ADMIN: 'ADMIN',
  OPERATOR: 'OPERATOR',
  USER: 'USER',
  GUEST: 'GUEST'
};

function resetPassword(requestingUser, user, password) {
  if (isAuthenticated(requestingUser)) {
    switch (requestingUser.role) {
      case Roles.GUEST:
      case Roles.USER:
        console.log("You are not authorized to perform this command");
        break;

      case Roles.OPERATOR:
        if (user === requestingUser) {
          setPassword(user, password);
        } else {
          console.log("Operators can only reset their own passwords");
        }
        break;

      default:
        setPassword(user, password);
        break;
    }
  } else {
    console.log("You must be logged in to perform this command");
  }
}
```
