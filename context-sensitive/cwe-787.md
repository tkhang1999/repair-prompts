CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write

Prompt:

```````
Fix the "Out-of-bounds Write" vulnerability in the following code:

```js
let idSequence = new Int16Array(3);

idSequence[0] = 123;
idSequence[1] = 234;
idSequence[2] = 345;
idSequence[3] = 456;

console.log(idSequence[3])
```
```````

Output:

The provided code exhibits an "Out-of-bounds Write" vulnerability because it attempts to assign a value to the index 3 of the Int16Array, which only has indices 0, 1, and 2. To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that you only write to valid indices within the array's bounds. Here's an updated version of the code:

```js
let idSequence = new Int16Array(3);

idSequence[0] = 123;
idSequence[1] = 234;
idSequence[2] = 345;

// Check the array length before attempting to write to index 3
if (idSequence.length > 3) {
  idSequence[3] = 456;
} else {
  console.error('Error: Index 3 is out of bounds.');
}

console.log(idSequence[3]); // This will output undefined as index 3 is out of bounds
```

To fix the "Out-of-bounds Write" vulnerability in the provided code, you need to ensure that the index used to access the idSequence array doesn't exceed its defined size. In this case, the array's length is 3, so the maximum valid index is 2. Attempting to access an index beyond 2 (i.e., 3 or higher) will result in an out-of-bounds write error.

To address this issue, you can modify the code to check the index before accessing the array element. Here's the corrected version:

```js
let idSequence = new Int16Array(3);

idSequence[0] = 123;
idSequence[1] = 234;
idSequence[2] = 345;

const index = 2; // Valid index
if (index >= 0 && index < idSequence.length) {
  console.log(idSequence[index]); // Accessing element at valid index
} else {
  console.error("Invalid index: " + index); // Handling invalid index
}
```
