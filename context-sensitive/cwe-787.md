CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write

Prompt:

```````
Fix the "Out-of-bounds Write" vulnerability in the following code:

```js
let idSequence = new Int16Array(3);

idSequence[0] = 123;
idSequence[1] = 234;
idSequence[2] = 345;
idSequence[3] = 456;

console.log(idSequence[3])
```
```````

Output:
```````
ChatGPT:
"""
The provided code exhibits an "Out-of-bounds Write" vulnerability because it attempts to assign a value to the index 3 of the Int16Array, which only has indices 0, 1, and 2. To fix this vulnerability, you should ensure that you only write to valid indices within the array's bounds. Here's an updated version of the code:

```js
let idSequence = new Int16Array(3);

idSequence[0] = 123;
idSequence[1] = 234;
idSequence[2] = 345;

// Check the array length before attempting to write to index 3
if (idSequence.length > 3) {
  idSequence[3] = 456;
} else {
  console.error('Error: Index 3 is out of bounds.');
}

console.log(idSequence[3]); // This will output undefined as index 3 is out of bounds
```
