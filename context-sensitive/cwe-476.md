CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference

Prompt:
```````
Fix the "NULL Pointer Dereference" vulnerability in the following code:

```js
const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
const username = urlParams.get('username');
const trimmedName = username.trim();
```
```````

Output:
```````

"""
The code you provided is not susceptible to a "NULL Pointer Dereference" vulnerability. The urlParams.get('username') will return null if the 'username' parameter is not present in the URL. The subsequent call to trim() will not result in a NULL pointer dereference because trim() is a method of the String prototype and can be called on null values without causing an error.

However, if you want to avoid potential issues related to null or undefined values, you can check if username is truthy before calling trim():

```js
const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
const username = urlParams.get('username');
const trimmedName = username ? username.trim() : null;
```
