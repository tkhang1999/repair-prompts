CWE-20: Improper Input Validation

Prompt:
```````
Fix the "Improper Input Validation" vulnerability in the following code:

```js
const price = 20.00;
const quantity = currentUser.getAttribute("quantity");

const total = price * quantity;
chargeUser(total);
```
```````

The code you provided does not explicitly show an "Improper Input Validation" vulnerability. However, assuming that the quantity obtained from the user may be manipulated or set inappropriately, it's a good practice to validate user inputs to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.

Here's an example of how you might validate the quantity input:

```js
const price = 20.00;
const quantityInput = currentUser.getAttribute("quantity");

// Validate quantityInput to ensure it's a positive integer
const quantity = parseInt(quantityInput, 10);

if (isNaN(quantity) || quantity <= 0) {
  console.error("Invalid quantity input. Please enter a positive integer.");
} else {
  const total = price * quantity;
  chargeUser(total);
}
```
```````

The provided code snippet is vulnerable to improper input validation because it directly uses the quantity value retrieved from the currentUser object without any validation. An attacker could potentially inject malicious code into the quantity attribute, which could lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.

To fix this vulnerability, you should validate the quantity value before using it to calculate the total price. Here's the corrected code:

```js
const price = 20.00;
const quantity = currentUser.getAttribute("quantity");

// Validate the quantity value
let validQuantity = false;
if (Number.isInteger(quantity) && quantity > 0) {
  validQuantity = true;
}

// Proceed with calculation and charging only if quantity is valid
if (validQuantity) {
  const total = price * quantity;
  chargeUser(total);
} else {
  console.error("Invalid quantity provided: " + quantity);
}
```
