The code you provided does not explicitly show an "Improper Input Validation" vulnerability. However, assuming that the quantity obtained from the user may be manipulated or set inappropriately, it's a good practice to validate user inputs to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.

Here's an example of how you might validate the quantity input:

```js
const price = 20.00;
const quantityInput = currentUser.getAttribute("quantity");

// Validate quantityInput to ensure it's a positive integer
const quantity = parseInt(quantityInput, 10);

if (isNaN(quantity) || quantity <= 0) {
  console.error("Invalid quantity input. Please enter a positive integer.");
} else {
  const total = price * quantity;
  chargeUser(total);
}
```
