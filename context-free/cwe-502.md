Prompt:

Fix the bug in the following code:

```js
const fs = require('fs');
const json = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('data.json', 'utf8'));

const user = json.user;
console.log(user.name);
```

The code you provided looks mostly correct, but there are potential issues that might lead to errors. Here are some improvements and considerations:

1. Error Handling: It's good practice to include error handling when reading from a file, especially when using synchronous methods like readFileSync.

2. Check for JSON Parsing Errors: If the contents of 'data.json' are not valid JSON, the JSON.parse function could throw an error. You should include error handling for this as well.

The bug in the provided code is that it assumes that the data.json file exists and contains valid JSON data. If the file does not exist or the JSON data is invalid, the code will throw an error. To fix this bug, you should use a try-catch block to handle potential errors. Here's the corrected code:

```js
const fs = require('fs');

try {
  const json = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('data.json', 'utf8'));
  const user = json.user;
  console.log(user.name);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error reading data.json:', error);
}
```
