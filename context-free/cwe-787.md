CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write

Prompt:

```````
Fix the bug in the following code:

```js
let idSequence = new Int16Array(3);

idSequence[0] = 123;
idSequence[1] = 234;
idSequence[2] = 345;
idSequence[3] = 456;

console.log(idSequence[3])
```
```````

Output:
```````

"""
The issue in the code is that the Int16Array is created with a length of 3, but you are trying to access the element at index 3. In JavaScript, array indices are zero-based, so the valid indices for an array of length 3 are 0, 1, and 2.

To fix the code, you should create the Int16Array with a length of 4 or access elements at valid indices (0, 1, 2) instead of 3:

```js
let idSequence = new Int16Array(4); // Fix the length to 4

idSequence[0] = 123;
idSequence[1] = 234;
idSequence[2] = 345;
idSequence[3] = 456;

console.log(idSequence[3]); // Accessing the valid index 3
```
