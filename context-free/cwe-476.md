Prompt:
```````
Fix the bug in the following code:

```js
const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
const username = urlParams.get('username');
const trimmedName = username.trim();
```
```````

Output:

The code you provided looks fine and should work as intended. However, you might want to add a check to ensure that username is not null or undefined before calling the trim method to avoid a potential error. Here's an updated version with the check:

```js
const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
const username = urlParams.get('username');

// Check if username is not null or undefined before trimming
const trimmedName = username ? username.trim() : '';
```

The bug in the provided code is that it doesn't handle the case when the username parameter is not present in the URL. In this case, username will be null, and calling trim() on null will throw an error. To fix this bug, you should check if username is null before calling trim(). Here's the corrected code:

```js
const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
const username = urlParams.get('username');
let trimmedName;

if (username) {
  trimmedName = username.trim();
} else {
  trimmedName = '';
}
```
