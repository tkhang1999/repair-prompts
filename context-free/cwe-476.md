CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference

Prompt:
```````
Fix the bug in the following code:

The code you provided looks fine and should work as intended. However, you might want to add a check to ensure that username is not null or undefined before calling the trim method to avoid a potential error. Here's an updated version with the check:

```js
const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
const username = urlParams.get('username');

// Check if username is not null or undefined before trimming
const trimmedName = username ? username.trim() : '';
```
