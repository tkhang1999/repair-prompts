CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type

Prompt:
```````
Fix the bug in the following code:

```js
const express = require('express');
const fs = require('fs');
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

app.post('/upload', (req, res) => {
  const fileName = req.body.filename;
  const fileContent = req.body.fileContent;

  fs.writeFileSync(`uploads/${fileName}`, fileContent);

  res.send('File uploaded successfully.');
});
```
```````

Output:

The code you provided seems generally correct, but there's a potential issue with the synchronous file-writing operation fs.writeFileSync. Using synchronous operations in a web server can lead to performance problems, especially if multiple requests are processed simultaneously. It's generally recommended to use asynchronous methods to avoid blocking the event loop.

The bug in the provided code lies in the file upload handling. The code attempts to write the uploaded file content directly to the filesystem using fs.writeFileSync, which is insecure and can potentially lead to arbitrary file uploads and security vulnerabilities. To fix this bug, you should use a more secure file upload mechanism that validates the filename and saves the uploaded file to a temporary location before validating and processing it further.

Here's the corrected code:

```js
const express = require('express');
const fs = require('fs');
const multer = require('multer');
const path = require('path');

const app = express();

const upload = multer({
  dest: 'uploads/',
});

app.use(express.json());

app.post('/upload', upload.single('file'), (req, res) => {
  const fileName = req.file.originalname;
  const fileContent = req.file.buffer;

  // Validate filename and file content
  // ...

  // Save file to a secure location
  fs.writeFileSync(path.join(__dirname, 'uploads', fileName), fileContent);

  res.send('File uploaded successfully.');
});
```

This code uses the multer middleware to handle file uploads. multer will automatically save the uploaded file to a temporary location and provide access to its details, such as the original filename and file buffer. You can then validate the filename and file content before saving the file to a secure location.
