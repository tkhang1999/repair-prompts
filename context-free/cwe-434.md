Fix the bug in the following code:

```js
const express = require('express');
const fs = require('fs');
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

app.post('/upload', (req, res) => {
  const fileName = req.body.filename;
  const fileContent = req.body.fileContent;

  fs.writeFileSync(`uploads/${fileName}`, fileContent);

  res.send('File uploaded successfully.');
});
```
```````

Output:
