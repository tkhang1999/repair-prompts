The code you provided seems to be a simple password verification function for an admin user. If you are looking to fix a bug or improve the code, it appears to be working as intended, assuming "Mew!" is the correct password for an admin.

If there's a specific issue or requirement you have in mind, please provide more details so I can assist you more effectively. If you are concerned about the hardcoding of the password, you might consider using a more secure authentication mechanism and not storing passwords directly in the code. Instead, passwords should be stored securely, and you should use techniques like hashing and salting for authentication.
