Fix the bug in the following code:

```js
const mysql = require('mysql');

function runEmployeeQuery(name, callback) {
  const connection = mysql.createConnection({ host: 'your_host', user: 'your_user', password: 'your_password', database: 'your_db' });
  connection.connect();

  const query = 'SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name = ?';
  connection.query(query, [name], (error, results) => {
    connection.end();
    callback(error, results);
  });
}
```

The code you provided seems mostly correct. However, to improve the handling of the database connection and potential errors, you might consider using the mysql.createPool method to create a connection pool, which is a recommended practice for managing database connections in a Node.js application. This can help with performance and better handle connection issues.

The bug in the code is that the connection to the MySQL database is not being closed properly. This can lead to a variety of problems, such as connection leaks and database lockups.

To fix the bug, you need to add a call to the connection.end() function after the callback function is called. This will ensure that the connection is closed properly and that the resources it is using are released.
