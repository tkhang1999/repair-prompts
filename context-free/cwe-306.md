	this.accountOwnerSSN = accountSSN;
	this.balance = balance;

The bug in the code is that the BankAccount class constructor is assigning the value of accountName to the property accountOwnerName. To fix this, change the line:

`this.accountOwnerName = accountName;`

to:

`this.accountName = accountName;`

This will ensure that the correct value is assigned to the accountName property. The corrected code is as follows:

```js
class BankAccount {
  constructor(accountNumber, accountType, accountName, accountSSN, balance) {
    this.accountNumber = accountNumber;
    this.accountType = accountType;
    this.accountName = accountName; // Corrected line
    this.accountOwnerSSN = accountSSN;
    this.balance = balance;
  }
}

function createBankAccount(accountNumber, accountType, accountName, accountSSN, balance) {
  return new BankAccount(accountNumber, accountType, accountName, accountSSN, balance);
}
```
