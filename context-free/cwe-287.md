Fix the bug in the following code:

The provided code looks generally correct for checking whether a user is logged in based on the presence of a 'loggedin=true' cookie. However, it's important to note that this check alone may not be secure enough for certain applications, as cookies can be manipulated by users.

If you are using this method for user authentication, you should also consider server-side validation to ensure the integrity of the user's authentication status.

The provided code snippet correctly checks for the presence of the loggedin=true cookie, but it doesn't handle the case where the cookie doesn't exist or is empty. To fix this, you should check for the existence and value of the loggedin cookie before using the match method. Here's the corrected code:

```js
const loggedinCookie = document.cookie.match(/loggedin=(true|false)/);

if (loggedinCookie && loggedinCookie[1] === 'true') {
  console.log('User is logged in!');
} else {
  console.log('Please login!');
}
```
