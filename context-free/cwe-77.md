CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')

Prompt:

Fix the bug in the following code:

```js
const exec = require('child_process').exec;

function readFile(fileName) {
  exec(`cat ${fileName}`, (error, stdout, stderr) => {
    if (error) {
      console.error(error);
      return;
    }
    console.log(stdout);
  });
}

const fileName = process.argv[2];
readFile(fileName);
```
```````

The code you provided looks generally fine, but there are potential security issues with using exec to execute shell commands, especially when user input is involved. It opens up the possibility of command injection attacks. It's recommended to use safer alternatives, such as fs.readFile, for reading files.

Here's an updated version of your code using fs.readFile:

```js
const fs = require('fs');

function readFile(fileName) {
  fs.readFile(fileName, 'utf8', (err, data) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error(err);
      return;
    }
    console.log(data);
  });
}

const fileName = process.argv[2];

if (fileName) {
  readFile(fileName);
} else {
  console.error("Please provide a file name as a command-line argument.");
}
```

The bug in the provided code is that the readFile function is not properly handling the fileName parameter. The fileName is being passed directly to the cat command, which can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities if the user provides malicious input. To fix this, the fileName should be properly sanitized before passing it to the cat command.

Here's the corrected code:

```js
const exec = require('child_process').exec;
const path = require('path');

function readFile(fileName) {
  const sanitizedFileName = path.normalize(fileName);
  exec(`cat ${sanitizedFileName}`, (error, stdout, stderr) => {
    if (error) {
      console.error(error);
      return;
    }
    console.log(stdout);
  });
}

const fileName = process.argv[2];
readFile(fileName);
```
