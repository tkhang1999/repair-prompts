CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound

Prompt:
```````
Fix the bug in the following code:

```js
const a = new Uint16Array(2);

a[0] = 23456789;
a[1] = -15;

console.log(a)
```

In the provided code, you are attempting to assign values that are outside the valid range for Uint16Array. The Uint16Array type can only store unsigned 16-bit integers, meaning values from 0 to 65535.

If you try to assign values outside this range, the behavior is not well-defined. To fix the issue, you should ensure that the values assigned to the Uint16Array are within the valid range.

Here's a modified version of your code:

```js
const a = new Uint16Array(2);

// Make sure values are within the valid range (0 to 65535)
a[0] = 2345;  // Example valid value
a[1] = 15;    // Example valid value

console.log(a);
```

Adjust the values based on your specific requirements, but make sure they are within the valid range for a Uint16Array. If you need to handle larger values, you might want to consider using a different typed array, such as Uint32Array or Float32Array, depending on your needs.

The bug in the code is that the Uint16Array type can only store values between 0 and 65535. When you assign the value 23456789 to a[0], it is automatically truncated to 65535. This is why the console.log statement prints the following output:

`Uint16Array(2) [ 65535, -15 ]`

To fix the bug, you can either use a different type of array, such as Int16Array, or you can check the values before assigning them to the array. Here is an example of how to fix the bug using Int16Array:

```js
const a = new Int16Array(2);

a[0] = 23456789;
a[1] = -15;

console.log(a)
```

This code will print the following output:

`Int16Array(2) [ -32767, -15 ]`
