CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound

Prompt:
```````
Fix the bug in the following code:

```js
const a = new Uint16Array(2);

a[0] = 23456789;
a[1] = -15;

console.log(a)
```
```````

Output:

"""
In the provided code, you are attempting to assign values that are outside the valid range for Uint16Array. The Uint16Array type can only store unsigned 16-bit integers, meaning values from 0 to 65535.

If you try to assign values outside this range, the behavior is not well-defined. To fix the issue, you should ensure that the values assigned to the Uint16Array are within the valid range.

Here's a modified version of your code:

```js
const a = new Uint16Array(2);

// Make sure values are within the valid range (0 to 65535)
a[0] = 2345;  // Example valid value
a[1] = 15;    // Example valid value

console.log(a);
```

Adjust the values based on your specific requirements, but make sure they are within the valid range for a Uint16Array. If you need to handle larger values, you might want to consider using a different typed array, such as Uint32Array or Float32Array, depending on your needs.
