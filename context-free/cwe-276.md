CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions

Prompt:
```````
Fix the bug in the following code:

```js
const fs = require('fs');

fs.writeFile('myfile.txt', 'This is my secret text.', { mode: 0o777 });
```
```````

Output:

The provided code writes content to a file using the fs.writeFile function and sets the file mode to 0o777 (readable, writable, and executable by everyone). However, setting such permissive permissions is usually not recommended for security reasons, as it allows anyone to modify and execute the file.

If the goal is to make the file readable and writable for the owner but not executable, you can use a more restrictive mode, such as 0o600. Here's the corrected code:

```js
const fs = require('fs');

fs.writeFile('myfile.txt', 'This is my secret text.', { mode: 0o600 }, (err) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Error writing file:', err);
  } else {
    console.log('File written successfully.');
  }
});
```

- Bard:

The provided code attempts to write the string "This is my secret text." to a file named "myfile.txt" while setting its permissions to 0o777 (full read, write, and execute permissions for all users). However, the code contains a bug: it's calling the fs.writeFile function without passing a callback function to handle the asynchronous operation.

To fix the bug, you need to provide a callback function to the fs.writeFile function. This callback function will be executed once the file has been written successfully. Here's the corrected code:

```js
const fs = require('fs');

fs.writeFile('myfile.txt', 'This is my secret text.', (err) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('An error occurred while writing the file:', err);
  } else {
    console.log('The file was written successfully.');
  }
});
