CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions

Prompt:
```````
Fix the bug in the following code:

```js
const fs = require('fs');

fs.writeFile('myfile.txt', 'This is my secret text.', { mode: 0o777 });
```
```````

Output:
```````
ChatGPT:
"""
The provided code writes content to a file using the fs.writeFile function and sets the file mode to 0o777 (readable, writable, and executable by everyone). However, setting such permissive permissions is usually not recommended for security reasons, as it allows anyone to modify and execute the file.

If the goal is to make the file readable and writable for the owner but not executable, you can use a more restrictive mode, such as 0o600. Here's the corrected code:

```js
const fs = require('fs');

fs.writeFile('myfile.txt', 'This is my secret text.', { mode: 0o600 }, (err) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Error writing file:', err);
  } else {
    console.log('File written successfully.');
  }
});
```
