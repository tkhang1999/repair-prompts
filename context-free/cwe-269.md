CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management

Prompt:
```````
Fix the bug in the following code:

```js
const Roles = {
  ADMIN: 'ADMIN',
  OPERATOR: 'OPERATOR',
  USER: 'USER',
  GUEST: 'GUEST'
};

function resetPassword(requestingUser, user, password) {
  if (isAuthenticated(requestingUser)) {
    switch (requestingUser.role) {
  	case Roles.GUEST:
  	case Roles.USER:
      console.log("You are not authorized to perform this command");
      break;

  	default:
      setPassword(user, password);
      break;
    }
  } else {
	  console.log("You must be logged in to perform this command");
  }
}
```
```````

Output:

The code seems mostly correct, but there's a missing definition for the isAuthenticated and setPassword functions, and it seems like you are checking the role of requestingUser but not the user when deciding whether to reset the password. If you intend to check the role of both the requesting user and the user for whom the password is being reset, you should adjust the code accordingly.

The bug in the code is that the switch statement is nested inside the if statement that checks if the requesting user is authenticated. This means that the switch statement will only be executed if the requesting user is authenticated. However, the setPassword function should be called regardless of whether the requesting user is authenticated or not.

To fix the bug, move the switch statement outside of the if statement. This will ensure that the switch statement is always executed, and that the setPassword function is called only if the requesting user has the appropriate role.

Here is the corrected code:

```js
const Roles = {
  ADMIN: 'ADMIN',
  OPERATOR: 'OPERATOR',
  USER: 'USER',
  GUEST: 'GUEST'
};

function resetPassword(requestingUser, user, password) {
  if (!isAuthenticated(requestingUser)) {
    console.log("You must be logged in to perform this command");
    return;
  }

  switch (requestingUser.role) {
    case Roles.GUEST:
    case Roles.USER:
      console.log("You are not authorized to perform this command");
      break;

    default:
      setPassword(user, password);
      break;
  }
}
```
