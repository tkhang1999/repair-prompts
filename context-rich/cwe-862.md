CWE-862: Missing Authorization

Prompt:
```````
Fix the bug in the following code:

```js
// Import the sql library
const mysql = require('mysql');

function runEmployeeQuery(dbName, name, callback) {
  // Establish connection to the database
  const connection = mysql.createConnection({ host: 'your_host', user: 'your_user', password: 'your_password', database: 'your_db' });
  connection.connect();

  // Construct the query to get employee details
  const query = 'SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name = ?';
  // Execute the query
  connection.query(query, [name], (error, results) => {
    connection.end();
    callback(error, results);
  });
}

// Call the function to get employee details
runEmployeeQuery('EmployeeDB', 'EmployeeName', (error, employeeRecords) => console.log('Done'));

// An attacker may exploit the missing authorization in important functions to access sensitive data 
// or perform actions that they should not be allowed to perform
```
