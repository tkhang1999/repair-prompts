CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions

Prompt:
```````
Fix the bug in the following code:

```js
const fs = require('fs');
// Write content to a file and set the file permission
fs.writeFile('myfile.txt', 'This is my secret text.', { mode: 0o777 });

// An attacker may exploit the full permission to access sensitive data in the system
```
```````

Output:
```````

To fix the security vulnerability related to setting file permissions, you should avoid using overly permissive permissions (e.g., 0o777) unless absolutely necessary. Instead, you should use more restrictive permissions that provide the necessary access without exposing the file to unauthorized users. Here's an updated version of the code with more secure file permissions:

```js
const fs = require('fs');

// Write content to a file and set more secure file permissions (e.g., 0o600 for read and write by the owner only)
fs.writeFile('myfile.txt', 'This is my secret text.', { mode: 0o600 }, (err) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(`Error writing to file: ${err.message}`);
  } else {
    console.log('File written successfully.');
  }
});
```
