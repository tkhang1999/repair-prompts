Fix the bug in the following code:

const fs = require('fs');
// Write content to a file and set the file permission
fs.writeFileSync('myfile.txt', 'This is my secret text.', { mode: 0777 });

// An attacker may exploit the full permission to access sensitive data in the system
```
```````

Output:
