CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management

Prompt:
```````
Fix the bug in the following code:

```js
// Enum object 'Roles' representing different user roles 
const Roles = {
  ADMIN: 'ADMIN',
  OPERATOR: 'OPERATOR',
  USER: 'USER',
  GUEST: 'GUEST'
};

// Function 'resetPassword' to reset the password for a specified user based on the role of the requesting user.
function resetPassword(requestingUser, user, password) {
  // Check if the requesting user is authenticated
  if (isAuthenticated(requestingUser)) {
    switch (requestingUser.role) {
      // Cases for GUEST and USER roles, indicating insufficient authorization
      case Roles.GUEST:
      case Roles.USER:
        console.log("You are not authorized to perform this command");
        break;

      // Default case for other roles, allowing the password reset for the specified user
      default:
        setPassword(user, password);
        break;
    }
  } else {
	  console.log("You must be logged in to perform this command");
  }
}

// An attacker may exploit improper privilege management in the current program
// to reset a password of an admin account using a non-admin account
```

To fix the privilege escalation vulnerability and improve the privilege management, you should compare the roles using a hierarchy and ensure that a user with a lower privilege cannot perform actions intended for users with higher privileges. You can modify the code as follows:

```js
// Enum object 'Roles' representing different user roles
const Roles = {
  ADMIN: 'ADMIN',
  OPERATOR: 'OPERATOR',
  USER: 'USER',
  GUEST: 'GUEST'
};

// Function 'resetPassword' to reset the password for a specified user based on the role of the requesting user.
function resetPassword(requestingUser, user, password) {
  // Check if the requesting user is authenticated
  if (isAuthenticated(requestingUser)) {
    // Check the hierarchy of roles to determine authorization
    if (hasHigherOrEqualPrivilege(requestingUser.role, Roles.USER)) {
      console.log("You are not authorized to perform this command");
    } else {
      // User has sufficient privileges to reset the password
      setPassword(user, password);
    }
  } else {
    console.log("You must be logged in to perform this command");
  }
}

// Helper function to check if a role has higher or equal privilege compared to a reference role
function hasHigherOrEqualPrivilege(role, referenceRole) {
  const roleOrder = {
    GUEST: 0,
    USER: 1,
    OPERATOR: 2,
    ADMIN: 3
  };

  return roleOrder[role] >= roleOrder[referenceRole];
}

// Example usage:
const requestingUser = { role: Roles.USER };
const targetUser = { role: Roles.ADMIN };
resetPassword(requestingUser, targetUser, "newPassword");
```

The bug in the resetPassword function lies in the default case of the switch statement. It allows any authenticated user with a role other than GUEST or USER to reset the password of any other user, including admin accounts.

To fix this bug, you can add an additional check within the default case to ensure that the requesting user has the same role or a higher role than the user whose password is being reset. This can be done using the following code:

```js
switch (requestingUser.role) {
  case Roles.GUEST:
  case Roles.USER:
    console.log("You are not authorized to perform this command");
    break;

  default:
    if (requestingUser.role >= user.role) {
      setPassword(user, password);
      break;
    } else {
      console.log("You are not authorized to reset the password of a user with a higher role");
    }
}
```
