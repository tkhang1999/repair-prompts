CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound

Prompt:
```````
Fix the bug in the following code:

```js
// Declare a 16-bit unsigned integer array of size 2
const a = new Uint16Array(2);

// Set values to elements of the array
a[0] = 23456789;
a[1] = -15;

console.log(a) // The printed array may not return previously set values
```
```````

Output:

- ChatGPT:
```````
The issue here is that Uint16Array represents an array of 16-bit unsigned integers, which means each element can only hold values in the range of 0 to 65535. If you try to set a value outside this range, it will be truncated or modified to fit within the valid range.

To fix the issue and correctly set values in the array, you can use Uint32Array if you need to store 32-bit unsigned integers. Here's an example:

```js
// Declare a 32-bit unsigned integer array of size 2
const a = new Uint32Array(2);

// Set values to elements of the array
a[0] = 23456789;
a[1] = -15 >>> 0; // Ensure that the negative value is converted to an unsigned 32-bit integer

console.log(a); // Now the printed array will contain the correct values
```

The bug in the code is that the values assigned to the array elements are not being stored correctly. This is because the Uint16Array type can only store values in the range of 0 to 65535. When you assign a value outside this range, the value will be truncated to fit within the range.

To fix this bug, you can use a different type of array, such as an Int16Array, which can store values in the range of -32768 to 32767. Or, you can check the values you are assigning to the array before assigning them to make sure they are within the valid range.

Here is an example of how to fix the code using an Int16Array:

```js
// Declare a 16-bit signed integer array of size 2
const a = new Int16Array(2);

// Set values to elements of the array
a[0] = 23456789;
a[1] = -15;

console.log(a) // The printed array should now return the previously set values
```
