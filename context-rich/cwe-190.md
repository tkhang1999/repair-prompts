CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound

Prompt:
```````
Fix the bug in the following code:

```js
// Declare a 16-bit unsigned integer array of size 2
const a = new Uint16Array(2);

// Set values to elements of the array
a[0] = 23456789; // this will result in integer overflow as max value of uint16 is 65535
a[1] = -15; // this will result in integer overflow as min value of uint16 is 0

console.log(a) // The printed array will not show the desired result, we want [23456789, -15]
```
```````

Output:

To fix the issue and achieve the desired array values, you can switch to using a Int32Array instead of Uint16Array since it seems you want to accommodate both positive and negative values. Here's the corrected code:

```js
// Declare a 32-bit signed integer array of size 2
const a = new Int32Array(2);

// Set values to elements of the array
a[0] = 23456789; // This value is within the range of a 32-bit signed integer
a[1] = -15; // This value is also within the range of a 32-bit signed integer

console.log(a); // The array will now display the desired values [23456789, -15]
```

The bug in the code is indeed related to integer overflow. Here's how to fix it:

1. Use a larger data type:

Instead of Uint16Array, use Uint32Array. This will give you 32-bit unsigned integers, which can handle much larger values. Your code would look like this:

```js
const a = new Uint32Array(2);
a[0] = 23456789;
a[1] = -15;
console.log(a); // [23456789, -15]
```

2. Handle overflow explicitly:

If you want to stick with Uint16Array, you can handle overflow manually. This involves checking the values before assigning them to the array and implementing logic to handle exceeding the maximum or minimum value. Here's an example:

```js
function clampValue(value) {
  if (value < 0) {
    return 0;
  } else if (value > 65535) {
    return 65535;
  } else {
    return value;
  }
}

const a = new Uint16Array(2);
a[0] = clampValue(23456789);
a[1] = clampValue(-15);
console.log(a); // [65535, 0]
```
