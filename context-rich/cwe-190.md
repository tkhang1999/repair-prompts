CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound

Prompt:
```````
Fix the bug in the following code:

```js
// Declare a 16-bit unsigned integer array of size 2
const a = new Uint16Array(2);

// Set values to elements of the array
a[0] = 23456789;
a[1] = -15;

console.log(a) // The printed array may not return previously set values
```
```````

Output:
```````

The issue here is that Uint16Array represents an array of 16-bit unsigned integers, which means each element can only hold values in the range of 0 to 65535. If you try to set a value outside this range, it will be truncated or modified to fit within the valid range.

To fix the issue and correctly set values in the array, you can use Uint32Array if you need to store 32-bit unsigned integers. Here's an example:

```js
// Declare a 32-bit unsigned integer array of size 2
const a = new Uint32Array(2);

// Set values to elements of the array
a[0] = 23456789;
a[1] = -15 >>> 0; // Ensure that the negative value is converted to an unsigned 32-bit integer

console.log(a); // Now the printed array will contain the correct values
```
