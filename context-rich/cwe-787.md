CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write

Prompt:
```````
Fix the bug in the following code:

```js
// Declare and initialize an int array in JavaScript
let idSequence = new Int16Array(3);

// Populate the array
idSequence[0] = 123;
idSequence[1] = 234;
idSequence[2] = 345;
idSequence[3] = 456; // No effect

console.log(idSequence[3]) // Print "undefined" instead of "456"
```
```````

Output:
```````

The issue in your code is that you are trying to access an index (idSequence[3]) that is beyond the size of the array. The Int16Array(3) declaration creates an array with a length of 3, so the valid indices are 0, 1, and 2. When you try to access idSequence[3], it goes beyond the array bounds, and the value is undefined.

To fix this, you can either declare the array with a larger size or adjust your indexing. Here's an example with a larger size:

```js
// Declare and initialize an int array in JavaScript
let idSequence = new Int16Array(4); // Increase the size to 4

// Populate the array
idSequence[0] = 123;
idSequence[1] = 234;
idSequence[2] = 345;
idSequence[3] = 456;

console.log(idSequence[3]); // Now it prints "456"
```
