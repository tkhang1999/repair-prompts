CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function

Prompt:
```````
Fix the bug in the following code:

```js
// Define the BankAccount class
class BankAccount {
  constructor(accountNumber, accountType, accountName, accountSSN, balance) {
	this.accountNumber = accountNumber;
	this.accountType = accountType;
	this.accountOwnerName = accountName;
	this.accountOwnerSSN = accountSSN;
	this.balance = balance;
  }
}

// Function to create bank account
function createBankAccount(accountNumber, accountType, accountName, accountSSN, balance) {
  return new BankAccount(accountNumber, accountType, accountName, accountSSN, balance);
}

// An attacker may exploit the missing authentication in important functions to access sensitive data 
// or perform actions that they should not be allowed to perform
```

Output:

To address the issue of missing authentication in important functions, you should implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms. One common approach is to associate a user or session with the bank account and validate that the user has the necessary permissions before allowing certain operations. Below is an example of how you might modify the code:

```js
// Define the BankAccount class
class BankAccount {
  constructor(accountNumber, accountType, accountName, accountSSN, balance, owner) {
    this.accountNumber = accountNumber;
    this.accountType = accountType;
    this.accountOwnerName = accountName;
    this.accountOwnerSSN = accountSSN;
    this.balance = balance;
    this.owner = owner; // Associate the account with a user or session
  }
}

// Function to create bank account
function createBankAccount(accountNumber, accountType, accountName, accountSSN, balance, owner) {
  return new BankAccount(accountNumber, accountType, accountName, accountSSN, balance, owner);
}

// Function to perform an action on a bank account, checking for authentication and authorization
function performActionOnAccount(user, bankAccount, action) {
  // Check if the user is authenticated and authorized to perform the action
  if (user && user.isAuthenticated && isAuthorized(user, bankAccount, action)) {
    // Perform the action
    console.log(`Action '${action}' performed on account ${bankAccount.accountNumber}`);
  } else {
    console.log('Authentication or authorization failed. Unable to perform the action.');
  }
}

// Function to check if a user is authorized to perform an action on a bank account
function isAuthorized(user, bankAccount, action) {
  // Check the user's role, permissions, or any other criteria to determine authorization
  // Example: Check if the user is the owner of the account
  return user.id === bankAccount.owner.id;
}

// Example usage:
const user = { id: 123, isAuthenticated: true };
const account = createBankAccount('123456789', 'Savings', 'John Doe', '123-45-6789', 1000, user);

// Attempt to perform an action on the account
performActionOnAccount(user, account, 'viewBalance');
```
