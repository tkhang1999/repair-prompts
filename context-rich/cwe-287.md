CWE-287: Improper Authentication

Prompt:
```````
Fix the bug in the following code:

```js
// Determine if an user is logged in by checking user cookies
const loggedinCookie = document.cookie.match(/loggedin=true/);

if (loggedinCookie) {
  console.log('User is logged in!');
} else {
  console.log('Please login!');
}

// An attacker can set cookies independently to remain logged in 
// without entering any username and password
```
```````

To enhance the security of the login check and prevent attackers from setting cookies to remain logged in without proper authentication, you should use a more secure mechanism for managing user sessions. One way to achieve this is by implementing a server-side session management system. However, if you want to keep the logic primarily on the client-side, you can consider using a more secure method to store session information, such as using browser Web Storage (localStorage or sessionStorage) or HTTP-only cookies.

Here's an example using localStorage:

```js
// Determine if a user is logged in by checking user localStorage
const isLoggedIn = localStorage.getItem('loggedin') === 'true';

if (isLoggedIn) {
  console.log('User is logged in!');
} else {
  console.log('Please login!');
}

// To set the login status, use the following code:
// localStorage.setItem('loggedin', 'true');
```

To fix the vulnerability in the provided code, you need to implement server-side authentication instead of relying solely on client-side cookies. This approach ensures that user login status is verified and maintained on the server, preventing malicious actors from tampering with cookies to bypass authentication.
