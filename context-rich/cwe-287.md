CWE-287: Improper Authentication

Prompt:
```````
Fix the bug in the following code:

```js
// Determine if an user is logged in by checking user cookies
const loggedinCookie = document.cookie.match(/loggedin=true/);

if (loggedinCookie) {
  console.log('User is logged in!');
} else {
  console.log('Please login!');
}

// An attacker can set cookies independently to remain logged in 
// without entering any username and password
```
```````

Output:
```
