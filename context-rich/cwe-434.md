CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type

Prompt:
```````
Fix the bug in the following code:

```js
// Import the Express framework
const express = require('express');

// Create an Express application
const app = express();

// Enable parsing of incoming JSON requests
app.use(express.json());

// Define a POST route for handling file uploads
app.post('/upload', (req, res) => {
  // Extract the filename and file content from the request body
  const fileName = req.body.filename;
  const fileContent = req.body.fileContent;

  // Save file to the server
  fs.writeFileSync(`uploads/${fileName}`, fileContent);

  // Respond with a success message
  res.send('File uploaded successfully.');
});

// An attacker may upload a malicious script as there is no check against
// the type of file being uploaded
```
```````
