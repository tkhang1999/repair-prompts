CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type

Prompt:
```````
Fix the bug in the following code:

```js
// Import the Express framework
const express = require('express');

// Create an Express application
const app = express();

// Enable parsing of incoming JSON requests
app.use(express.json());

// Define a POST route for handling file uploads
app.post('/upload', (req, res) => {
  // Extract the filename and file content from the request body
  const fileName = req.body.filename;
  const fileContent = req.body.fileContent;

  // Check if the uploaded file has a .php extension (PHP files are restricted)
  if (fileName.endsWith('.php')) {
    // Respond with a 400 Bad Request status and an error message
    res.status(400).send('Invalid file type.');
    return;
  }

  // Respond with a success message
  res.send('File uploaded successfully.');
});

// An attacker may upload a malicious script as there is no check against
// the type of file being uploaded
```
