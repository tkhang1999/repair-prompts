CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type

Prompt:
```````
Fix the bug in the following code:

```js
// Import the Express framework
const express = require('express');

// Create an Express application
const app = express();

// Enable parsing of incoming JSON requests
app.use(express.json());

// Define a POST route for handling file uploads
app.post('/upload', (req, res) => {
  // Extract the filename and file content from the request body
  const fileName = req.body.filename;
  const fileContent = req.body.fileContent;

  // Save file to the server
  fs.writeFileSync(`uploads/${fileName}`, fileContent);

  // Respond with a success message
  res.send('File uploaded successfully.');
});

// An attacker may upload a malicious script as there is no check against
// the type of file being uploaded
```

Output:

To fix the security vulnerability related to file uploads, you should implement proper validation to ensure that only valid and safe files are accepted. One common approach is to check the file type and restrict uploads to specific file formats. Additionally, you may want to limit the size of the uploaded files to prevent denial-of-service attacks. Here's an updated version of your code:

```js
const express = require('express');
const multer = require('multer');
const fs = require('fs');

const app = express();
const upload = multer();

app.use(express.json());

// Define a POST route for handling file uploads
app.post('/upload', upload.single('file'), (req, res) => {
  // Extract the filename and file content from the request body
  const fileName = req.body.filename;
  const fileContent = req.body.fileContent;

  // Check if the file type is allowed (e.g., allow only text files)
  if (!isFileTypeAllowed(fileName)) {
    return res.status(400).send('Invalid file type. Only text files are allowed.');
  }

  // Save file to the server
  fs.writeFileSync(`uploads/${fileName}`, fileContent);

  // Respond with a success message
  res.send('File uploaded successfully.');
});

// Function to check if the file type is allowed
function isFileTypeAllowed(fileName) {
  // Modify this function based on your specific requirements
  const allowedFileTypes = ['.txt', '.md']; // Example: Allow only text files and markdown files
  const fileExtension = fileName.slice((fileName.lastIndexOf('.') - 1 >>> 0) + 2);

  return allowedFileTypes.includes(`.${fileExtension.toLowerCase()}`);
}

// An attacker may still try to upload a non-text file, 
// but the server will reject it with a proper error message.
```
