CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type

Prompt:
```````
Fix the bug in the following code:

```js
// Query the upload form
const uploadForm = document.querySelector('form#upload-form');

uploadForm.addEventListener('submit', async (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  // Get the uploaded file from the form
  const file = uploadForm.querySelector('input[type="file"]').files[0];

  // Upload the file to the server
  const response = await fetch('/upload', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: file
  });

  console.log(response);
});

// An attacker may upload a malicious script as there is no check against
// the type of file being uploaded
```
```````

Output:
