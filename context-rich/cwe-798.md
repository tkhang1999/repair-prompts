Fix the bug in the following code:

```js
// Verify if an user has the admin privilege
function verifyAdmin(password) {
  // Check if the entered password is correct
  if (password !== "Mew!") {
    return 0;
  }

  return 1;
}

// An attacker may be able to read the hard-coded password and compromise the system
```
